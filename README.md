# week-4-game

### Update (April 13, 2017) this is an earlier project. While it is a functional game, I would like to make some changes to improve the user experience and the interface. For example, I would like to remove characters from the DOM that are no longer playing. I would like to make the game plays, wins, and losses more obvious to the user. For a better representation of UI/UX, check out one of my new repos such as [VolunTier](https://github.com/hadicodes/VolunTier)

Welcome to the Batman RPG game. In this game you get to select any of the 4 characters to figh an opponent. Each opponent has  a 100% health value and varying attack and counter attack power levels. Each one of your attacks on an opponent simultaneously mirrors an attack from the opponnent on to you so that you also lose health points based on the particular opponents counter attack power. Carefully select a character who will allow you to stay alive long enough to attack and kill your opponents. Try to stay alive and defeat all the opponnents to win the game!

Good luck!
